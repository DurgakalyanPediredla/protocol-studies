# What is a Blockchain?

System where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by a bunch of these nodes in the network. And the reason why the term Blockchain is used because the data structure that these systems use atleast so far is one where they run of different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks. And a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer like a hash of previous blocks that it builds on top of. And so you have a series of blocks that nodes in the network create where each block points to the previous block and so you have this chain of them.

## Ethereum Node and Client Software

An Ethereum node refers to a server or computer that operates Ethereum client software, which includes both the execution client (like Geth, Besu, or Nethermind etc.) responsible for processing smart contracts and transactions, and the consensus client (like Lighthouse or Lodestar, etc.) responsible for participating in the consensus mechanism. Nodes collectively form the Ethereum network, and each node connects to other nodes running compatible client software. This network of nodes is crucial for the decentralized nature of Ethereum, as it ensures the propagation of transactions, blocks, and the overall state of the blockchain across the entire network.

### **Note:**

All the client softwares are built from diversified programming languages and they have their own unique interfaces and system requirements.
